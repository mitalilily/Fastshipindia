# FastShip deployment

FastShip uses Render as its primary deployment platform. The public landing
and merchant client are packaged into one free Static Site. The manual GitHub
Actions workflows remain available only for the separate Linux VPS deployment path.

## Render deployment

The Render configuration defines these services:

| Component | URL | Root directory | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Landing + client | `https://fastship-piwy.onrender.com` | `express-magic` | Static Site |
| Admin panel | `https://fastshipadmin.onrender.com` | `express-magic/admin-dashboard` | Static Site |
| Backend API | `https://fastshipindia.onrender.com` | `express-magic/backend` | Docker Web Service |

No Blueprint or second client service is required. Configure the existing
`fastship-piwy` Static Site with Root Directory `express-magic`, Build
Command `npm run build`, and Publish Directory `combined-dist`. The root build
packages the Feather landing at `/` and the merchant app at `/app/`.

Keep backend secrets in their existing Render service. Do not replace the current
database URL or encryption keys with placeholders. The checked-in `render.yaml`
is an optional configuration reference; Blueprint deployment is not required.

### Combined landing and client settings

The merchant login URL is
`https://fastship-piwy.onrender.com/app/#/login`. Client routing uses the URL hash,
so login/dashboard reloads do not require a paid feature or host rewrite.

- Root directory: `express-magic`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `combined-dist`
- Static Site price: free on a Render Hobby workspace

Set these build-time environment variables:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://fastshipindia.onrender.com/api
VITE_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://fastshipindia.onrender.com
```

`VITE_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `VITE_PUBLIC_GEOAPIFY_KEY` are optional and must contain the real provider values only when those features are enabled.

### Admin panel settings

- Root directory: `express-magic/admin-dashboard`
- Build command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Add the rewrite from `/*` to `/index.html` in the existing Static Site settings.

Set these build-time environment variables:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://fastshipindia.onrender.com/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://fastshipindia.onrender.com
```

### Backend settings

- Root directory: `express-magic/backend`
- Runtime: `Docker`
- Dockerfile path: `./Dockerfile` relative to the `backend` root directory
- Health check path: `/health`
- Region: the same region as the Render Postgres database

The backend URL is misconfigured if `/` or `/api` returns landing page HTML. A
correct deployment returns `{"status":"ok"}` from `/health`.

Set these environment variables in the backend service:

| Variable | Value to provide manually |
| --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | The **new Internal Database URL** copied from the Render Postgres **Connect** menu after rotating the exposed database password. Do not use a URL committed to Git. |
| `API_URL` | `https://fastshipindia.onrender.com` (no `/api`) |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://fastship-piwy.onrender.com,https://fastshipadmin.onrender.com` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `https://fastship-piwy.onrender.com/app` |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` | A unique random secret of at least 32 bytes. Generate it locally with `openssl rand -base64 48`. |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` | A different unique random secret of at least 32 bytes. |
| `COURIER_SECRET_KEY` | A third unique random secret used to encrypt stored courier credentials. Keep this stable after production data exists. |
| `ADMIN_SEED_EMAIL` | The real production administrator email address. |
| `ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD` | A unique strong initial administrator password. Change it after first login and keep it out of Git. |
| `AUTH_OTP_DELIVERY` | `screen` to show the login code in the client panel. Use `email` or `both` only when SMTP should also send the same code. |
| `AUTO_MIGRATE_ON_START` | `true` for the first deployment or automatic schema bootstrap; set `false` only after migrations are managed separately. |

Render supplies `PORT`; do not hardcode it. Courier, payment, email, storage, Shopify, and Google variables are feature-specific and should be added only with real values from those providers.

After editing environment variables, choose **Save, rebuild, and deploy**. A push to the connected `main` branch also triggers an automatic deploy when Auto-Deploy is enabled.

## Production layout

The manual VPS deployment expects this layout:

| Component | VPS path | Public host |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Landing site | `/srv/fastship/current/landing` | `fastship.in` |
| Client panel | `/srv/fastship/current/courier-cart-client` | `client.fastship.in` |
| Admin panel | `/srv/fastship/current/admin-dashboard` | `admin.fastship.in` |
| Backend API | `/srv/fastship/current/backend` | `api.fastship.in` |

Nginx configuration is stored in `deploy/nginx/fastship.conf`. The backend is managed by PM2 using `backend/ecosystem.config.cjs` and reads `backend/.env.production` on the server. That file must never be committed.

## Workflow behavior

All SSH workflows are manual-only:

- `Deploy VPS (Manual)` deploys the repository to the VPS.
- `Server Debug` inspects the running VPS and PM2 logs.
- `Amazon Shipping Smoke` runs an Amazon Shipping check from the VPS.

Normal pushes are deployed by the connected Render services and do not run the VPS workflow. A manually started VPS workflow intentionally fails when required SSH secrets are absent, because reporting a successful deployment without contacting the server would be misleading.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Use these exact canonical names. Legacy `FASTSHIP_*` aliases are not used.

| Secret | Required value | Where to obtain it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FASTSHIP_HOST` | The VPS public IPv4 address or DNS hostname only, for example `server.example.com`. Do not include `https://`, a path, username, or port. SSH port 22 is assumed. | VPS provider dashboard, server inventory, or the person who provisioned the VPS. |
| `FASTSHIP_USER` | The Linux SSH login username that can access the VPS and run non-interactive `sudo`, such as the provisioned deployment account. This is not a GitHub username unless that is genuinely the Linux account name. | VPS provisioning record or `/etc/passwd` on the server. |
| `FASTSHIP_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Full contents of the unencrypted private key whose public key is installed in `~FASTSHIP_USER/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Include the `BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY` and `END ... PRIVATE KEY` lines and preserve newlines. Do not paste the `.pub` key. | The secure machine or password manager where the deployment key pair was created. Create a dedicated key if none exists. |
| `FASTSHIP_PASSWORD` | The real SSH password for `FASTSHIP_USER`. Use only when private-key authentication is unavailable. | VPS provider credentials or the server administrator. |

`FASTSHIP_HOST` and `FASTSHIP_USER` are always required. For authentication, provide `FASTSHIP_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` or `FASTSHIP_PASSWORD`; the private key is preferred. You do not need both.

### Create a dedicated SSH key

Run this on a trusted administrator machine, not in GitHub Actions:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "fastship-github-actions" -f fastship-deploy
```

For unattended GitHub Actions deployment, the key must not require an interactive passphrase. Install `fastship-deploy.pub` in the deployment user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the VPS. Store the complete contents of `fastship-deploy` as `FASTSHIP_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`. Keep the private key out of the repository.

Before adding it to GitHub, verify the same credentials manually:

```bash
ssh -i fastship-deploy FASTSHIP_USER@FASTSHIP_HOST
sudo -n true
```

Replace `FASTSHIP_USER` and `FASTSHIP_HOST` with the real values. Both commands must succeed. The workflow uses `sudo`, so an account without non-interactive sudo access is insufficient.

## Optional integration secrets

These do not control SSH access. The deploy workflow skips an integration sync when its required pair is absent.

### Amazon Shipping

| Secret | Value to provide | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AMAZON_SHIPPING_REFRESH_TOKEN` | The production Amazon Shipping OAuth/LWA refresh token for the merchant account. | Amazon Shipping authorization flow or the administrator who completed account authorization. |
| `AMAZON_SHIPPING_LWA_CLIENT_ID` | Production Login with Amazon client ID associated with the Amazon Shipping application. | Amazon Developer Console, under the application's LWA security profile. |
| `AMAZON_SHIPPING_LWA_CLIENT_SECRET` | Matching production LWA client secret. | Amazon Developer Console, from the same security profile. |
| `AMAZON_SHIPPING_GSTIN` | The business's real 15-character GSTIN used for Amazon Shipping tax details. | The company's GST registration record. Required when the Amazon Shipping account/API requires GST tax details. |

Do not substitute AWS access keys, an Amazon password, or sandbox credentials for these values.

### Shopify OAuth

| Secret | Value to provide | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID for the production Shopify app. | Shopify Partner/Dev Dashboard, app client credentials. |
| `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret for the same production Shopify app. | Shopify Partner/Dev Dashboard, app client credentials. |

Configure this exact production redirect URI in Shopify:

```text
https://api.fastship.in/api/integrations/shopify/oauth/callback
```

Configure this compliance webhook endpoint in the Shopify app settings:

```text
https://api.fastship.in/api/webhooks/shopify/compliance
```

Shopify scopes are configuration, not credentials. Add them as the optional repository variable `SHOPIFY_SCOPES`, not as a secret. When omitted, the workflow uses the repository's built-in order, customer, product, webhook, and fulfillment scopes.

### Razorpay live mode

| Secret | Value to provide | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID_PROD` | Live-mode Razorpay key ID, normally beginning with `rzp_live_`. | Razorpay Dashboard, Account & Settings, API Keys, Live Mode. |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET_PROD` | Secret generated with the matching live key ID. | Razorpay Dashboard at key creation time or the approved password manager. Regenerate it if lost. |
| `RAZORPAY_MERCHANT_ID_PROD` | Merchant ID for the production Razorpay account. Optional unless the account flow requires it. | Razorpay Dashboard account details. |
| `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET_PROD` | The exact secret configured for the production webhook endpoint. Optional unless Razorpay webhooks are enabled. | Razorpay Dashboard, Webhooks. This is not the API key secret. |

Never use test-mode `rzp_test_` credentials for this production workflow.

## Repository variables

Variables are configured separately from secrets because they are not credentials.

| Variable | Required | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEPLOY_RUNTIME_USER` | No | Linux account that owns and runs the deployed application. Defaults to `deploy`. Set it only when the VPS uses another real account. |
| `SHOPIFY_SCOPES` | No | Comma-separated Shopify OAuth scopes if the app needs to override the built-in defaults. |
| `SHOPIFY_SEND_OAUTH_SCOPE` | No | `true` only when the OAuth request must send scopes explicitly; otherwise omit it or set `false`. |

## Configure GitHub

1. Open the GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
3. Under **Secrets**, select **New repository secret**.
4. Add `FASTSHIP_HOST` and `FASTSHIP_USER` with the real VPS values.
5. Add either `FASTSHIP_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` or `FASTSHIP_PASSWORD`.
6. Add only the integration secrets for providers that are actually enabled in production.
7. Under **Variables**, add optional `DEPLOY_RUNTIME_USER`, `SHOPIFY_SCOPES`, or `SHOPIFY_SEND_OAUTH_SCOPE` when needed.

The current workflows read repository-level Actions secrets. Adding similarly named values only in Render does not make them available to GitHub Actions.

## Run and verify

1. Open **Actions > Deploy VPS (Manual)**.
2. Select **Run workflow** on `main`.
3. Confirm that **Validate deploy secrets** passes.
4. Confirm that **Configure deploy SSH** authenticates successfully.
5. Confirm that the build and deployment steps finish and `.deployed_commit` is updated on the VPS.
6. Verify `https://fastship.in`, `https://client.fastship.in`, `https://admin.fastship.in`, and `https://api.fastship.in`.

If validation reports a missing name, create that exact repository secret. If SSH configuration fails, verify the host, Linux username, port 22 connectivity, key pairing, and non-interactive sudo access. Do not commit credentials to solve either error.
