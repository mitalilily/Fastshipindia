Shipping and Courier Services
- Courier serviceability, pickup availability, transit time, delivery attempt rules, RTO handling, weight disputes, and tracking updates depend on the integrated courier and lane.
- A shipment is accepted for processing only after required shipment data, courier allocation, and manifest requirements are completed.
- AWB generation, manifesting, pickup scans, transit scans, and final delivery events may be delayed by courier systems, network conditions, address issues, weather, strikes, holidays, or regulatory checks.
- You agree to cooperate with support requests for invoices, product proofs, KYC documents, customer details, weight evidence, or other information required to resolve courier exceptions.

Rates, Wallet, and Payments
- Rate calculator amounts are estimates until the shipment is validated, manifested, scanned, and billed using the final applicable weight, zone, plan, payment mode, and charges.
- You must maintain sufficient wallet balance or approved payment terms before shipment processing where payment is required.
- Applicable charges may include freight, COD charges, fuel surcharge, GST, weight discrepancy charges, RTO charges, address correction fees, remote area charges, and other courier or platform charges.
- Invoices and statements must be reviewed promptly. Any billing concern should be raised with supporting details within the timeline communicated by Ship Aggregator.

COD and Remittance
- COD collections are handled according to courier confirmations, remittance cycles, reconciliation data, deductions, and platform records.

- You are responsible for providing correct bank and settlement details and for reviewing remittance reports.

Cancellations and Refunds
- You may request cancellation of shipments or services through the available platform flow or by contacting support.
- Cancellation is subject to shipment status, courier acceptance, manifest status, pickup status, and charges already incurred.

Data and Privacy
- ${TERMS_PRIVACY_POLICY_LINE}
- By using the platform, you consent to this processing and to sharing relevant shipment, customer, KYC, billing, and tracking information with couriers, payment processors, technology providers, auditors, legal authorities, and support teams where necessary.
- You must provide your customers with appropriate notices and permissions before sharing their personal data with Ship Aggregator for shipment processing, tracking, COD, NDR, RTO, support, and communication.
- You can request correction, access, or deletion of eligible personal information by contacting cs@shipaggregator.com or 9906690088, subject to legal, accounting, courier, fraud-prevention, and dispute-retention requirements.

Service Availability and Liability
- The platform is provided on an as-is and as-available basis. We work to keep it reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free, or delay-free operation.
- Ship Aggregator is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or loss-of-profit damages arising from platform use, courier delays, failed pickups, delivery exceptions, third-party outages, or inaccurate information submitted by you.
- Nothing in these terms limits liability that cannot legally be limited.

Suspension and Termination

- You may stop using the platform or request account closure by contacting cs@shipaggregator.com or 9906690088.
- Outstanding charges, reconciliation items, claims, disputes, and legal obligations survive account closure.

Updates to These Terms
- We may update these terms to reflect service changes, courier requirements, legal obligations, pricing changes, or operational improvements.
- Continued use of the platform after an update means you accept the revised terms.

Contact and Grievance
- For terms, privacy, billing, shipment, refund, or grievance questions, contact Ship Aggregator at cs@shipaggregator.com or 9906690088.
